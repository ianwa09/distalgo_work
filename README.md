# DistAlgo Lamport Mutual Exclusion Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of Lamport's mutual exclusion algorithm in DistAlgo.

This DistAlgo implementation of Lamport's distributed mutual exclusion algorithm allows a more efficient and highly readable implementation of this algorithm for distributed systems. The core logic is contained in a single declarative await() condition, ensuring a process can only enter its critical section when it has received acknowledgments (abbr. 'ack') from all other processes and holds the highest priority based on logical time stamps. Unlike traditional implementations that use polling-based code with manual message handling and state management, DistAlgo enables incremental computation to atuomatically optimize the condition evaluation, only re-checking when relevant messages arrive rather than continuously polling across all conditions. This results in much better performance while maintaining accuracy. This is a replication of an example from https://distalgo.cs.stonybrook.edu/tutorial.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7** (DistAlgo does not support Python 3.8+)
- **DistAlgo package**: Install with `py -3.7 -m pip install pyDistAlgo`

## Quick Start

1. **Install DistAlgo**:

   ```bash
   py -3.7 -m pip install pyDistAlgo
   ```

2. **Run the algorithm**:
   ```bash
   py -3.7 -m da lamport.da 3 2
   ```
   - `3` = number of processes
   - `2` = number of critical section requests per process

## Files

- `lamport.da` - Main DistAlgo implementation
- `test.da` - Simple test file to verify DistAlgo installation

## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Use .da file extension, not .py!**

DistAlgo is a domain-specific language that compiles to Python. Files must have `.da` extension for proper compilation. (I learned this the hard way ü§£)

### Python Version Issues

- **Error**: `Python version X.Y.Z is not supported`
- **Solution**: Always use `py -3.7` explicitly (3.8 and 3.9 are also supported, but I have not tested with them yet)

### Import Errors

- **Error**: `NameError: name 'process' is not defined`
- **Cause**: Using `.py` extension or wrong Python version
- **Solution**: Use `.da` extension and Python 3.7

### Pattern Matching Errors

- **Error**: `NameError: name 'c2' is not defined`
- **Solution**: Use `some(received(('ack', c2, p)))` for proper variable binding

## My Debugging Journey

### The Problem Chain

1. **Python Version Conflicts** - System defaulted to Python 3.13
2. **Import Hell** - Treated DistAlgo as regular Python library
3. **Low-Level API Struggles** - Tried to instantiate processes manually
4. **Configuration Nightmares** - Couldn't configure `global_init()` properly
5. **File Extension Revelation** - Used `.py` instead of `.da`
6. **Syntax Issues** - Incorrect pattern matching syntax

### Things that I learned..

- DistAlgo is a **DSL that compiles to Python**, not a Python library
- **File extensions matter**: `.da` triggers compilation, `.py` runs raw Python
- **Version consistency**: Every command needs explicit `py -3.7`
- **High-level syntax**: Use `process`, `new()`, `start()` after compilation
- ~2 hours of debugging

## Algorithm Details

This implements a simplified version of Lamport's mutual exclusion algorithm:

1. **Request**: Process sends request with logical timestamp to all others
2. **Acknowledge**: Other processes send acknowledgments
3. **Enter**: Process enters critical section after receiving all acks
4. **Release**: Process sends release message and exits critical section

## Usage Examples

```bash
# 2 processes, 1 request each
py -3.7 -m da lamport.da 2 1

# 5 processes, 3 requests each
py -3.7 -m da lamport.da 5 3

# Default: 3 processes, 2 requests each
py -3.7 -m da lamport.da
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Verify Python version**: `py -3.7 --version`
2. **Check DistAlgo installation**: `py -3.7 -c "import da; print(da.__version__)"`
3. **Test with simple file**: `py -3.7 -m da test.da`
4. **Ensure .da extension**: DistAlgo won't work with `.py` files
